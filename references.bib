To this end, it offers electron/positron beams with user-selectable momenta from 1-6GeV/c. The available infrastructure for the users is unique, including a high field solenoidal magnet and permanently installed high-precision pixel beam telescopes. This publication gives a detailed description of the facility, the available infrastructure, and the simulated and measured performance.}

	journal = {Physics in Medicine and Biology},
	abstract = {The main advantages of proton therapy are the reduced total energy deposited in the patient as compared to photon techniques and the finite range of the proton beam. The latter adds an additional degree of freedom to treatment planning. The range in tissue is associated with considerable uncertainties caused by imaging, patient setup, beam delivery and dose calculation. Reducing the uncertainties would allow a reduction of the treatment volume and thus allow a better utilization of the advantages of protons. This paper summarizes the role of Monte Carlo simulations when aiming at a reduction of range uncertainties in proton therapy. Differences in dose calculation when comparing Monte Carlo with analytical algorithms are analyzed as well as range uncertainties due to material constants and CT conversion. Range uncertainties due to biological effects and the role of Monte Carlo for in vivo range verification are discussed. Furthermore, the current range uncertainty recipes used at several proton therapy facilities are revisited. We conclude that a significant impact of Monte Carlo dose calculation can be expected in complex geometries where local range uncertainties due to multiple Coulomb scattering will reduce the accuracy of analytical algorithms. In these cases Monte Carlo techniques might reduce the range uncertainty by several mm.}

In the CERN SPS H8 beamline (180 GeV π+) a resolution of better than 8 × 12 μm2 at the position of the device under test was achieved. The telescope reached a trigger rate of 6 kHz with two measured devices. It is mainly designed for studies using FE-I4 based prototypes, but has also been successfully run with independent DAQ systems. Specialised trigger schemes ensure data synchronisation between these external devices and the telescope. A region-of-interest trigger can be formed by setting masks on the first and the last pixel sensor planes. The setup infrastructure provides centrally controlled and monitored high and low voltage power supplies, silicon oil cooling, temperature and humidity sensors and movable stages.}
