\chapter{Introduction}
The investigation of particles and their properties is the fundament of particle physics. With the development of the standard model in the past century, particles were able to
be classified and their interactions with other particles could be better understood. Particles can be divided into quarks and leptons, making up the matter in the universe,
gauge bosons, which mediate three of the fundamental forces and the higgs boson.

In order to analyse interactions of particles they are accelerated and brought to collision inside of particle colliders. Subsequent particles created in such collisions
can be detected with a surrounding detector system and thus the events can be reconstructed, giving us insight of their behaviour. It is therefore crucial to have
an optimal working detector to analyse of the produced data precisely.

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) located at CERN is a proton proton collider and currently the largest particle collider, being able to accelerate protons up to $\SI{14}{\tera\eV}$.
It operates since 2008 and helped particle physicists in finding the last missing particle of the standard model, the higgs boson, as well as giving more insight
into properties of particles like the top quark. Standard model parameters can be measured with greater precision, improving our understanding and enables physicists to
test their theories. Physics beyond the standard model is also searched for at the LHC with great interest.

Besides the use of detectors in high energy physics experiments they are also a crucial part of medical equipment, specifically used for radiative treatments.
The idea to use protons as an effective particle for the treatment of cancer arose in 1946 and over the years it proved to have several advantages over
conventional x-ray therapy. To apply proton therapy, a radiation plan has to be created to determine the location of the tumor and the dose of the radiation.
For that purpose tomogrophy scans create images of the inside of patients, enabling the precise irradiation of tumors.
Benefits of using protons for tomogrophy scans in comparison to x-ray tomogrophy scans for proton therapy caused a growing interest in this technique. \\
In order to create images with proton computed tomography, the reconstruction of proton tracks traversing the human body is necessary.

This thesis focuses on the reconstruction protons under conditions present in proton computed tomography scans. To achieve that, the new track reconstruction software
Corryvreckan is analysed based on its capability of reconstructing tracks in comparison to the EUTelescope framework. Furthermore, it is used to reconstruct
protons, which are generated in Allpix$^2$ simulations to investigate the possibility of making proton computed tomography scans feasible with this framework.
